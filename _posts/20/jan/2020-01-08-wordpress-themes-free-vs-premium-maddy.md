**Have you ever wondered what the difference between free WordPress themes and paid and paid ones are?**

[Maddy Osman](https://twitter.com/maddyosman) answers many of the following question below that most people have when theyâ€™re decided what WordPress theme they should choose. 

- _Do you really need a premium theme to have a beautiful website?_
- _Does a premium theme guarantee that your website will run faster?_
- _What are the disadvantages of sticking with a free theme?_
- _Free/premium WordPress themes? Which one is right for any given project?_

Among all the great information and helpful tips that Maddy provides In her [post](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-free-vs-paid-themes/) I found this useful tips about free themes offered for WordPress very useful.

## Why all free themes are not created equal 

Free themes found in the WordPress repository are not like free themes that  you find online, which she mentions are rarely updated, leaving them open to security vulnerabilities. The themes found in the WordPress repository are heavily screened, from the code to the accessibility.

If you are deciding on a free theme it's best to stick with the ones in the dashboard but if you do decide to download one off the internet she provides a process to help you find one that won't ruin your site later on.
