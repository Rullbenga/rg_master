## Why Your Website Should Be Built On WordPress
You might be trying to decide whcih platform to make your website with,

I’m going to give you a few reasons why you should consider making your website with WordPress instead of going an alternative route, but first...

What is WordPress?
WordPress is a software known as a CMS (content management system)  that you can use to make a beautiful websites in a jiffy. 

### Some of the reasons I think you should build your website with WordPress

- You don’t need to know about coding or programming

- The visual dashboard makes it easy for you to manage your content        instead of relying on a developer to do it for you

- Beautiful designs are only a click away

- Plugins make it possible for you to have features that you thought only giant corporations could have

- It can help you automate boring yet necessary tasks for your business (appointment scheduling, conference confirmations, email responses

- The WordPress community is large and very helpful, most of the time Googling a problem will show you the solution

All of these reasons can help free up your time and resources which could be better used elsewhere

## The learning curve
You will have to become familiar with the dashboard to do some of the tasks I listed above.  This can be a bit of a challenge when your not a computer person like me who’s owned one since he was 5, but I think anyone can get the basics down. 

As long as you learn how to publish your information and edit your content ,invsting in a WordPress website should be inexpensive compared to some of the other options; hiring a developer or an agency.

WordPress is an amazing software on its own and when you give it to someone who’s more familiar with the concepts of web design and WordPress you can create a beautiful and highly functioning representation of your business on the internet, for the world to see.
