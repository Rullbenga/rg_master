## Why should I use analytics for my website?

Web Analytics are essential for anyone interested in keeping track of their progress with just about anything they're trying to excel at.  They can help you see if your efforts are affecting your website in a positive, negative, or neutral way.

## Running for analytics

A runner can use analytics to help them get better at running.  By keeping track of things like the distances they run, calories they burn, calories they intake, and their mile times, they would be able to get a better idea of where they could improve to help them run faster and longer.

## How can web analytics improve my website?

For websites this is especially important, by setting up analytics you can track your web traffic to help you better understand things like

- Live information as it happens
- Visitor behavior, see how much time users spent on what page
- Where your user are are located
- See when a visitor came to your website
- The most visited pages on your site
- What pages get the most clicks on your site
- What links your users clicked to get your website
- New or returning visitors
- Highest web traffic times

All of these things can help you get to know your audience better, which can help you optimize your content to help them understand what you're trying to explain.
