## Why should I use analytics for my website?

I believe using Web Analytics is essential for anyone interested in keeping track of their progress with just about anything they're trying to get better in.  They can help you see if your efforts are affecting your website in a positive, negative, or neutral way.

## Stair climbing analytics

I like to climb stairs every other day because it helps me stay healthy and relieves everyday stress.  I used to run, but that started taking a toll on my knees. Now by keeping track of things like the food I eat, the calories I burn, and the distances I cover, I've been able to improve my workouts,build muscle, and lose weight without having to put in a whole lot of extra effort like before. When you know what's working and what's not you can make informed decisions rather than relying on chance.

## How can web analytics improve my website?

I think for websites, analytics are especially important because they can help you get to know your visitors.  

Any time I try to explain something that sounds a bit complex to someone I know, I find that the conversation goes a lot smoother if I use refrences or comparisons to something they interested in.  I think you can do the same with your content, when you know who you're talking to, it makes it easier and more enjoyable to communicate with that person.

Analytics inform you about information like: 

- Live information as it happens
- Visitor behavior, see how much time users spent on what page
- Where your users are located
- See when a visitor came to your website
- The most visited pages on your site
- What pages get the most clicks on your site
- What links your users clicked to get your website
- New or returning visitors
- Highest web traffic times

Becoming familiar with all this information can help you get to know your audience.  This can make it easier for you to write content that easier to  relate to. 

## [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)

Analytics Tools like Google Analytics can tell you more in-depth information about your visitors, for example:
 	
- The browser they use
- Their interests / pastime
- Their age
- The network provider they use
- Their gender
- The devices they used to visit your site (laptops, iPhones, androids)

& much more. On top of that, Google Analytics is **FREE!**.

[Nick Schäferoff](https://twitter.com/nschaeferhoff) over at [websitesetup.org](https://websitesetup.org/) has a lot of in-depth information about Google Analytics.  His [post](https://websitesetup.org/) helped me learn a few extra things about analytics.  His post also includes tutorials showing you how to install Google Analytics with a WordPress plugin and how to do it manually by adding the javascript code in the core files of your website through and FTP client.

## Conclusion

I think website analytics can help you make better decisions about where you should invest your time, money, and effort.  Because they help you become more familiar with the people visiting your website, they can help you make content tailored for them.
