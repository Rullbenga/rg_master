[Roger Montti](https://twitter.com/martinibuster) does an excellent job of explaining some of the cool new features in the Gutenberg 7.1 update.


## New Features
There’s a lot of new and interesting features in the 7.1 WordPress update which includes better table options, bug fixes, and oddly enough some lower benchmark speeds. You can learn more about it on his [post](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/wordpress-announces-gutenberg-7-1-its-big/340097/#close).

Some of the more stand out features are it’s improvement in mobile editing.  Having a fixed mobile toolbar is going to make it easier to edit web content on the go, no need to fire up the rig to do a 2 second task.
