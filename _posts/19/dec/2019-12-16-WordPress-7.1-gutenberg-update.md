## New Features
There’s a lot of new and interesting features in the 7.1 WordPress update which includes better table options, bug fixes, and oddly enough some lower benchmark speeds. You can learn everything about in his his [post](https://twitter.com/realvjy).

Some of the more stand out features are it’s improvement in mobile editing.  Having this new option to edit WordPress websites on the go is going to make it easier for users and developers of the platform to edit content straight from their phone, no more firing up the old rig to do a 2 second task.
