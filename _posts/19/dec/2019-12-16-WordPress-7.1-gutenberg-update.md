[Roger Montti](https://twitter.com/martinibuster) does an excellent job of explaining some of the cool new features in the Gutenberg 7.1 update.


## New Features
Thereâ€™s a lot of new and interesting features in the 7.1 WordPress update which includes better table options, bug fixes, and oddly enough some lower benchmark speeds. You can learn more about it on his [post](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/wordpress-announces-gutenberg-7-1-its-big/340097/#close).


## Mobile Fixed Toolbar
Some of the more stand out features that I found interesting are it's improvements to mobile editing.

The new update will add a fixed toolbar during mobile editing.   This looks like it's going to make it easier to edit and create content for my clients and myself with a lot more ease, no need to fire up the old rig every time.
