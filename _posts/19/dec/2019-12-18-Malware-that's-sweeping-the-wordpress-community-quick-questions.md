## What is WP-VCD?

WP-VCD is the name given to the malware that’s currently running a muck on the WordPress community by hijacking user's websites and redirecting the links to pop-ups and scammy sites that usually end up asking for money.

## Is WP-VCD targeting anyone is specific?

Yes, WP-VCD is mainly targeting WordPress users seeking to download premium themes and plugins for free from third party websites.  

It usually starts with a google search for a premium plugin that a website might offer for free.  After you’ve installed these plugins, the malware quickly takes over.

Less commonly seen but still a threat, you can get infected through outdated themes or plugins as well.

## What does WP-VCD do to my website?

The malware redirects the links throughout your website to adverts like these;

This intrusive practice is known as malvertising.

[Malvertising](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2015/02/what-is-malvertising/) are those pesky pop-ups that come up now and then when you go on a spammy looking website. These adverts usually start flashing personal information about you or the computer your on and immediately ask you for money to fix a problem.

The WP-VCD malware can also access diffrent WordPress websites found on the same server as an infected website, which makes this a threat for anyone using hosting services.

Some of the common symptoms associated with the WP-VCD malware are malicious pop-ups, unsolicited redirects, spammy looking URLs, and slow speeds.  If you're experiencing any of these, your website might be infected.

## How can you get infected with WP-VCD?

The malware is mainly spreading through pirated plugins and themes.  If you need to add functionality or redesign your website, it’s best to avoid sketchy sites and to download only from reputable sources. 

## How to avoid being infected by WP-VCD?
