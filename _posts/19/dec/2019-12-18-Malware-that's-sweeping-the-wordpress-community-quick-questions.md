I read an article about how WordPress websites are still being affected by a malware known as WP-VCD.  The malware has been affecting WordPress users since August of 2019 and is still spreading.

In this post I've written down some simplified questions and answers about this wide spread infection that's affected the WordPress community.  I gathered a lot of information from this [aritcle](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/11/wp-vcd-the-malware-you-install-on-your-own-sites/) by [Mikey Veenstra](https://twitter.com/heyitsmikeyv).  He does an amazing job of informing you about this malware.  Mikey Veenstra also has a [full report](https://www.wordfence.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Wordfence-WP-VCD-Whitepaper.pdf) about WP-VCD that covers just about everything.

## What is WP-VCD?

WP-VCD is the name given to the malware that’s currently running a muck on the WordPress community by hijacking user's websites and redirecting the links to pop-ups and scammy sites that end up asking you for money.

## Is WP-VCD targeting anyone is specific?

Yes, WP-VCD is mainly targeting WordPress users seeking to download premium themes and plugins for free from non reputalbe third party websites.  It seems to me that this is the reason it's spreading so fast, the promise of a paid free plugin seems to attract someone trying to save money, and who isn't trying to save money.

Less commonly seen but still a threat, you can get infected through outdated themes or plugins as well.  In his report Mikey Veenstra also mentions that when a website is infected the WordPress websites on the same server can also be infected if they're not updated. This 

## What does WP-VCD do to my website?

The malware redirects the links throughout your website to adverts like these;

I like so many others have seen these. I remember when I first saw them browsing the internet as a kid in the early 2000's, they spook you by displaying keyword specific information about you or the computer your on.  Never call them either because theirs usually some guy on the other line pressing you for money about a problem that doesn't exist, learned that one the hard way, lol.

A quick Google search later and I found out that this practice is known as [Malvertising](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2015/02/what-is-malvertising/) in the advertisment industry. 

Some of the common symptoms I read are associated with the WP-VCD malware are malicious pop-ups, unsolicited redirects, spammy looking URLs, and slow speeds.  If you're experiencing any of these, your website might be infected.

## How can you get infected with WP-VCD?

The malware is mainly spreading through pirated plugins and themes.  If you need to add functionality or redesign your website, it’s best to avoid sketchy sites and to download only from reputable sources.

Because you can be infected by other websites that might be on the same server yours is on, you can't be entirely sure your website is safe but you can take some steps to make sure it's less likely to affect yours.  Here are some points recommended by Mikey Veenstra and a few by me to help you avoid this all together. and to take extra steps to save your website if it does happen to you

- Run a malware scanner to check for intruders

- The most cautionary thing you can do is stay alert.  Be very careful about the plugins and themes and where you download them. 

- If you have a developer who handles your website, confirm that they’re getting their resources from credible places. 

- If money is the issue, consider free plugins and themes from well-known websites. 

- Update your plugins as soon as you can

- Back your website up!
