Check out this [free set of illustrations](https://illlustrations.co/) provided by [Vijay Verma](https://twitter.com/realvjy), the current lead designer at Zomato.

Vijay recently went back into an old hard drive and found these illustrations he which he made in 2016 on his journey to becoming the well known designer he is today. 

## Who can use these illustrations?

If you look at the hero on the illustrations.co website on the last line you can see “Free for Commercial and Personal Use. No need to credit, license, or anything.”

There are a lot of different illustrations you can use for your projects in this set, among them are ; an iPod, a bedroom set, a forklift, a cassette tape, an e-bike,a GPU, a sailboat, a Christmas tree, and city arrangements.  All of Vijay illustrations come in both SVG and PNG format which makes it a lot easier to download and work with.
