## I've got a WordPress website now

PLUG INS!, from [web analytics](/_posts\19\dec\2019-12-22-web-analytics-why-you-need-them-to-succeed-google-analytics-wordpress-tutorial.md) to heatmap tracking and all the way to an automatic appointment scheduler, I think adding plugins to your WordPress site is essential to making it successful, not to mention it's easier than writing all that code yourself.  

With about 55,000 free plugins and a vast selection of paid ones, WordPress plugins are one of the biggest reasons that [%35](https://www.whoishostingthis.com/compare/wordpress/stats/) of all the websites in the world are WordPress websites. Plugins can transform your website into both an efficient form of communication and a multi-purpose tool that can help any business run smoother.  Because of these reasons, I believe you should familiarize yourself with WordPress plugins and how they work.

I found this [post](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-add-plugins-to-wordpress--cms-34369) by [Jessica Thornsby](https://tutsplus.com/authors/jessica-thornsby?_ga=2.163666940.271766277.1576952798-1833700103.1576952798) does an excellent job of explaining almost everything about WordPress plugins.  I've made a list of questions she answers in that post. 

### Some question you should ask when learning about WordPress plugins
