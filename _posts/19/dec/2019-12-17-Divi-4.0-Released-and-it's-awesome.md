Divi 4.0 was recently released by [elegantthemes](https://www.elegantthemes.com/) and it's buzzing!

The most notable feature to me about this amazing page builder is its templating system.  The new templating system is going to allow users to have more control of the design and functionality of their website.

You can read all about it [here](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/theme-releases/divi-4).



## What will the new templating system do?
Divi’s new templating system gives you the ability to create different page layouts for different pages. It opens your website up to possibilities that other page builders didn't before. Rather than using the same header, footer and sidebars the new Divi 4.0 will let you override existing layouts and have more design options available. All of this done through their beatiful interface with ease.

## What is a situation in which Divi’s new templating system could be beneficial for my website?
If your tired of the way your website looks, and you want to spice up the visuals on your blog or your about page Divi’s new templating system can help you do that.  With a few setting changes you could have more aesthetically pleasing blog post, archived pages, or wherever you need to add some spice.

Having a visually pleasing website can have a positive effect on user experience, .  

## Better Design for WordPress Users
As a WordPress Developer, Divi 4.0 is going to make it more accessible for me and other WordPress developers to create beautiful websites without having to have too many technical restraints.

Overall Divi 4.0 is a beautiful and highly funtionable theme that I look forward to working with in the future.
