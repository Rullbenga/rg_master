Divi 4.0 was recently released by [elegantthemes](https://www.elegantthemes.com/) and it's buzzing!

The most notably feature to me about this amazaing page builder is their templating system.  The new templating system is going to allow users to have more control of their websites design and functionality.

You can read all about it [here](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/theme-releases/divi-4).



## What will the new templating system do?
Divi’s new templating system gives you the ability to create different page layouts for different pages, it opens up possibilities in your websites design that weren’t there before.  Instead of using the same header, footer and sidebars you’ll be able to override existing layouts and have more design options available throughout your website while being able to control it all with ease.

## What is a situation in which Divi’s new templating system could be beneficial for my website?
If your tired of the way your website looks, and you want to spice up the visuals on your blog or your about page Divi’s new templating system can help you do that.  With a few settings changes you could have a more aesthetically pleasing blog post or archived pages while keeping the rest of your website in tact. 

Having a visually pleasing website can have a positive effect on user experience.  

## Better Design for WordPress Users
As a WordPress developer Divi 4.0 is going to make it more accessible to create beatiful websites without having to compromise design due to technical restrains, Divi 4.0 is a beaut/iful and amazing theme that I look forward to working with in the future.
