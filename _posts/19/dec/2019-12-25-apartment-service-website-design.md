I made this a while ago and uploaded it for anyone to download.  To me, this is one of the better websites I mocked up. 

**Descriptions**: I gave this website a minimialist website design.  It looks very sleek and modern.  I picked an orange color as the main theme to give it vibrant accents throughout the website to highligh important areas.
The hero 

I enjoy making simplisitic web design because it helps users navigate website better.

The websites hero section includes a two column layout with one side giving the user who landed on the page a call to action along with a email form to enourage them to sign up for a news letter; having a newsletter can help you capture leads.  The other column includes images of apartments that can help give the user a good idea of the type of spaces you have listed.

The section below includes a "how it works" section. Since this web design concept revolves around providing users with filtered lists of apartment they might be intrested in, this section highlights the process in 3 simple steps to encourage them to engage .

Below that is the websites "meet the team" section, this section is designed to help build trust which includes pictures of the individuals who are in charge of this business.
