I"u	<p><strong>Why Your Website Should Be Built On WordPres</strong>
You might be trying to decide which platform to make your website with, I’m going to give you a few reasons why you should consider making your website with WordPress instead of going an alternative route, but first…</p>

<p>What is WordPress?
WordPress is a software known as a CMS (content management system)  that you can use to make a beautiful websites in a jiffy.</p>

<h3 id="some-of-the-reasons-i-think-you-should-build-your-website-with-wordpress">Some of the reasons I think you should build your website with WordPress</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You don’t need to know about coding or programming</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The visual dashboard makes it easy for you to manage your content        instead of relying on a developer to do it for you</p>

    <p><img src="/images\20\jan\wordpress-dashboard-user-interface.png" alt="WordPress-dashboard" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beautiful designs are only a click away</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plugins make it possible for you to have features that you thought only giant corporations could have</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can help you automate boring yet necessary tasks for your business (appointment scheduling, conference confirmations, email responses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The WordPress community is large and very helpful, most of the time Googling a problem will show you the solution</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of these reasons can help free up your time and resources which could be better used elsewhere</p>

<h2 id="the-learning-curve">The learning curve</h2>
<p>You will have to become familiar with the dashboard to do some of the tasks I listed above.  This can be a bit of a challenge when your not a computer person like me who’s owned one since he was 5, but I think anyone can get the basics down.</p>

<p>As long as you learn how to publish your information and edit your content ,invsting in a WordPress website should be inexpensive compared to some of the other options; hiring a developer or an agency.</p>

<p>WordPress is an amazing software on its own and when you give it to someone who’s more familiar with the concepts of web design and WordPress you can create a beautiful and highly functioning representation of your business on the internet, for the world to see.
