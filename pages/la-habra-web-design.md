## Are you looking to make a website for your business or maybe you want to redesign your website?
 
Hi I'm **Ruben Gutierrez** and I provide Website Design services for the in the city of [La Habra](https://www.lahabracity.com), California located right at the corner of good ol' Orange County.
 
My goal is to help people make websites that best represent them and their business. I attend the annual [Corn Festival](http://lahabracornfestival.com/?page_id=46)  with my family every year, and I'm very familiar with the city I grew up in.
 
### What I think set met apart.
 
-   **Modern Website Design**
 
    My websites in comparison to the other web design business websites around the city of La Habra look exponentially better.  I make them look more modern and not like something from the early 2000's.
 
    With me, you can expect website made with current design techniques and a snappy user experience. 
 
-   **Responsive Website Design**

    While other web design companies install themes and just leave them as they are, I both hand code and adjust themes so they fit on all types of devices without compromising the look of your website.
    
    Not only are mobile responsive website favored by google but they also help serve your potential customers using their phones to find local businesses. 
 
    Google also prioritizes website with mobile functionality, not only is this a plus for your business but it's now more necessary than ever.
 
    **Work Ethic**
 
    While other businesses promise a speedy process I make sure I don't stop until your work is properly done.

#### Here are some frequently asked questions that can help you understand the process of web design
 
##### How long will it take for you to make my website?
Because everyones websites needs are different it's hard to really place an exact timeline but if your website is relatively small (7 - 15 pages) you can expect it to be up in a couple of weeks. Bigger websites that require more work will take longer.
 
##### How much will my website cost?
The price of a website completely depends on your needs.  If you want top notch design quality along with a lot of functionality you can expect to pay over a thousand dollars, but if you just want something that looks decent and represents your business than you can expect to pay a few hundred dollars.  If you need a quote donâ€™t hesitate to contact me.
 
##### Can I pay my website off in payments?
Because the price of a website can be range from a few hundred dollars to a few thousands we can work out an installation plan.

I mainly work with the popular CMS WordPress, but I also hardcode custom websites.
