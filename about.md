**Ruben Gutierrez** is a Freelance Web Developer & Designer from [La Habra, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Habra,_California).  After realizing his childhood passion was a career path, he set out to learn as much about the web as he could.  Fast forward 4 years later and he has helped multiple small businesses around the US create websites that perfectly represent their brand.  

Aside from helping small businesses, Ruben also contributes to open source design by distributing his web designs for free.  His open source work has been downloaded thousands of times by both individuals and web design companies.

Ruben mainly works with the popular Content Management System WordPress, but prefers to create websites from scratch with HTML, CSS, & JS and all the libraries and frameworks in between.

When Ruben isn’t on his computer typing away, he’s as far away from it as possible, somewhere in the hills of California.
